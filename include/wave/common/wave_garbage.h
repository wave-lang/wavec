/**
 * \brief Basic garbage collector.
 *
 * wave_garbage_collector is a very basic garbage collector for Wave programs.
 * One can either:
 * - wave_garbage_alloc(): Allocate memory which will be automatically registered.
 * - wave_garbage_register(): Register memory inside the garbage collector.
 *
 * It is up to the user to clean or destroy the garbage collector:
 * - wave_garbage_clean()
 * - wave_garbage_destroy()
 *
 * The main difference between wave_garbage_clean() and wave_garbage_destroy()
 * is the fact that the former frees the registered memory but keeps the garbage
 * collector's internal storage while the latter frees both the registered
 * memory and the internal storage.
 * Thus, it is advised to call:
 * - wave_garbage_clean(): during the lifetime of the program.
 * - wave_garbage_destroy(): at the end of the program.
