.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wave2c
.I INPUT [OUTPUT]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program preprocesses Wave code. The resulting code can be compiled into C code using \fBwave2c\fR.
.P
For more information on the Wave language, please

.SH USAGE
This program expects 1 or 2 arguments. The first argument is the input file, while
the second argument is the output.
.P
If the second argument is omitted, the program will output to the standard output.

.SH EXAMPLES
To preprocess a Wave file:
    $ \fBwavepp\fR input.w output.wpp

To write the resulting code to stdout:
    $ \fBwavepp\fR input.wpp

To directly produce C code from raw Wave code:
    $ \fBwavepp\fR input.w | \fBwave2c\fR - ouput.c
